LookFile Inspector v0.2

An experiment in displaying the contents of a LookFile in Katana.
You can just type in any path, or right-click a LookFileAssign or
LookFileBake node when a LookFile Inspector tab is visible.

Each pass, and root location within a pass is presented in a tree 
along with the locations that are affected by the look file.

A couple of different options are available for how attribues
and scenegraph locations are displayed. Trying some things out.

Attributes can be displayed either hierarchicaly, or as a flat list.
The affected Scenegraph can also be optionaly displayed as a flat list.

If attributes are set to 'Spread Sheet' mode - the display can be sorted
by any column.

Wild cards can be used in the search box glob style. 

Hold down shift when expanding/double-clicking to expand all children.


NOTES:

 - Search is incredibly naive/basic at present.
 - There is very little in the way of progress display and the likes
 - Attribute values are literal, and un-truncated.

 
INSTALLATION:

Put the LookFileInspector directory in a 'Tabs' folder anywhere on
your $KATANA_RESOURCES. It will then be available in the Tabs menu.


KNOWN ISSUES:

 - If you close an instance of the Tab, and make a new one, it may be
blank. If this happens, make another, and close the blank one.

 - Check marks don't appear next to the curent state in the Options
menu items

 - Tabs can't save state, so display preferences are stored in your
home directory. This means that the last set state will be re-applied
to any open Tabs when they are restored.
